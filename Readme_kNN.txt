## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This project demonstrates **supervised learning** using the **K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN)** algorithm in R to predict the **size category of sedans** based on their numerical features.  

The goal is to:
- Perform **data preprocessing** and exploration  
- Build and evaluate a **KNN classification model**  
- Identify the optimal **k-value** that yields the highest predictive accuracy
