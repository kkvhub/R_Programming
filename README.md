## 📘 Overview
This project applies the K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) algorithm in R to predict 
sedan size based on numeric vehicle features.

## 📂 Folder Structure
- `data/` → input datasets (e.g., SedanSize.csv)  
- `scripts/` → R code files for data preparation, training, and evaluation  
- `output/` → plots, confusion matrices, and results  
- `docs/` → any reports or supporting materials  

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open `scripts/KNN_SedanSize_Model.R` in RStudio.  
2. Set working directory to project root using `setwd()`.  
3. Run the script line by line to reproduce results.

## 🧰 Requirements
Install required packages:
```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "class", "corrplot"))
```
